# duco-miners

duco-miners is a super simple terminal "dashboard" for you to view a list of your Duino Coin miners. The output automatically updates every 15 seconds and provides you with a break down of each of your miners (in alphabetical order) as well as an overview of all of your miners and your current balance.
